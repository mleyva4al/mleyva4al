## Featured Projects

### Network Config Generator
🔹 https://github.com/mleyva4al/network-config-generator  

Web-based tool designed to support **real network device configuration and network practices**.

- Generates configuration commands for routers and switches  
- Calculates subnetting and available hosts per network  
- Allows copying commands for real devices or Packet Tracer  
- Generates PDF reports for networking practices  

This project was created to simplify repetitive configuration tasks when working with **real equipment and network simulators**.

### Dictámenes Management System (PHP)
🔹 *(Repository available on GitHub)*  

Web system developed as part of an academic project for managing technical reports across multiple delegations.

- Secure login with hashed passwords  
- Role-based access control (Administrator and Technician)  
- Completely different interfaces per user role  
- Full CRUD operations  
- Export data to PDF, Excel, and text files  
- Audit logs and data persistence  
- Developed with PHP, SQL, and XAMPP  

The system ensures that **technicians never have access to administrative functions under any circumstance**.
